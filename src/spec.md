## Summary
**Goal:** Enlarge the artwork images in the Gallery page to make them significantly more prominent while preserving the list layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase the dimensions of artwork images in the gallery list
- Ensure images fill their container width completely
- Maintain titles positioned below images within the same card

**User-visible outcome:** Gallery artwork images appear noticeably larger and more impactful while retaining the familiar list layout with titles beneath each image.
