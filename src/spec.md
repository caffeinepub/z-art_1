# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reduce the size of the Upload Artwork button on the main upload page.

**Planned changes:**
- Reduce the width and height of the Upload Artwork button/input control on the main upload page (UploadView)
- Proportionally reduce the clickable area to match the smaller visual size
- Ensure the button remains clearly visible and accessible after the size reduction

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a smaller, more compact Upload Artwork button on the main upload page while maintaining full functionality.
