  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-6 by reducing the size of the Upload Artwork button/input control in AdminUploadForm.tsx through smaller padding (p-4 vs p-8), smaller icon size (h-8 w-8 vs h-12 w-12), smaller text (text-xs vs text-sm), reduced gap (gap-1.5 vs gap-2), and constrained width (max-w-xs mx-auto). The changes are specifically applied to the upload control on the main upload page (UploadView uses AdminUploadForm), meeting all acceptance criteria.",
